# wordpress-docker-starter

This repo is a quick starter project for local dev environments for Wordpress with docker.

I needed this to quickly spin up local instances without much fuss but with some extras when dealing with third-party sites which have no CI or any workflow in place.
## Quick start

Run with `docker-compose up -d`
